Title
How University student body population relates to Corona Virus cases on campus and to cases within the school county.

Purpose
Collect data necessary to investigate the relationship between covid-19 
cases by county in comparison to the top 100 universities in 
the United States by undergraduate population.  We were curious if there
would be a correlation between the population size of the county,
the number of students, and the number of covid-19 cases in the county and the
university.

Sources
The sources of data used for the collection of data are as follows:
1.  https://www.niche.com/blog/the-100-largest-colleges-in-america/
2.  https://www.whatcountyamiin.com/
3.  https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage_70769902

Extract and Transform
The original data was formatted in several ways.
1.  the data was in an html table.  The website prevented the use of Pandas so the page was scrapped
to extract the data into a pandas df.  This was then exported to a csv.

The address of each university was included in a page by clicking on the link of each university name.
Each university name was scraped to collect the address.  This address was added to the dataframe and 
used in the next step, step 2.

2.  This website was scraped using the address from the tables above.  By entering the address of each
school the webpage would output the county in which that address was located.  This county along with the
school name was collected.  There were a few errors resulting from incorrect addresses or POboxes.  These were fixed
on a one by one basis.

The resulting files from steps 1 are 2 is:
university_county_list.ipynb
county_school.ipynb
ranked_schools_with_county.csv

3.  This data was downloaded from the census website.  It included many, many columns of data.
The columns chosen to keep were 2019 population, county and state.
county_state_pop.ipynb
county_population.csv

4.  The covid data was collected over a time frame of April 1 until August 3.  This included many covid
related data types for each county in which the 100 schools in item 1 were located.  As there is the possibility
of county names overlapping into different states, the key chosen for county was county-state.  This ensured
there would be a unique name for each county.  Because all other data sets were not time based, we decided
to fix the date of 7-28-2020 to use for comparison.  This corresponds to the date of the study in item 5.

covid_county_test_data.csv
covid_county_test_data_7-28-2020.csv

5.  We were very fortunate to discover a very recent article in the New York Times listing the actual
covid-19 cases for virtually every school in the country as of 7-28-2020.  The list is ranked by number 
of cases from highest to lowest.  We collected the number of cases for each of the schools in the top 100
list of item 1.  This dataset was not in a table format so it was scraped as well and collected into a dataframe
and then csv.

There was an extensive amount of data cleaning required for the data.
a.  The university names in the top 100 list and those of the NYT article did not match.  There is not
standard way of referencing schools at specific locations, e.g. Ohio State - Columbus versus other 
Ohio State campuses.  The college names were homogenized across the 2 lists.  There were also "-" or " "
that needed to be either added or removed from the names in addition to the occasionaly "*" used in the
NYT article for further clarification.
b.  Values in % and integers with "," for thousands needed to be cleaned.
c.  All of the counties included the word "county" in their name.  This was not necessary and made it difficult
to match the county-state pairs.  The word "county" was removed.

Database

Looking at the ERD we chose 5 csv files to use for the database.  In addition to the raw data we needed to
have datasets with Keys sufficient to permit a link between county-state and universities, covid cases, and
population.  We also needed a Key to allow the number of cases at the universities to be linked with the
university population and other data.

The schema used to create the database in PostreSQL is
college_county_covid_schema.sql

The csv files above were added to the SQL database with the file
upload-to-db.ipynb

The collections of data were imported into PostgreSQL to prepare for analysis.  A backup of the database is
located on github.
